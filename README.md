# Grey Ghost

Simple Markdown text editor for the Windows desktop.

## Overview

I was reading up on the open source port of Markdown written in C# as part of the library [MarkdownSharp][1] in use over at [StackOverflow][2]. I could not find much for the Windows desktop that was simple and not part of an IDE or a full blown text editor.

## Requirements

Windows Presentation Foundation (or WPF)

* Windows XP+
* Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0+

Tested on Windows 7, Microsoft .NET Framework v4.0.30319

### Other

The Weimaraner's coat colour led to its nickname of "the Grey Ghost" and then the name of this project. Ghostwriting may have come into play since I tend to write things all over the place. I have a 7 year old Weimaraner, Jack.
