# Grey Ghost

I was reading up on the open source port of Markdown written in C# as part of the library [MarkdownSharp][1] in use over at [StackOverflow][2]. I could not find much for the desktop that was simple and not part of an IDE or a full blown text editor.

## Requirements

Windows Presentation Foundation (or WPF)

* Windows XP+
* NET Framework 3.0.

### Other

I have a 7 year old Weimaraner, Jack. The Weimaraner's coat colour led to its nickname of "the Grey Ghost" and then the name of this project. Ghostwriting may have come into play since I tend to write things all over the place.
